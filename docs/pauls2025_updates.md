**Comparison of Methodologies: Pauls et al. (2025) vs. Pauls et al. (2024)**

### ðŸ”§ **Methodological Advances in Pauls et al., 2025**

Compared to the 2024 version, the 2025 study introduces substantial methodological improvements for large-scale and **temporally explicit** canopy height estimation, with a specific emphasis on capturing **tall trees** (above 30â€“35 m), where previous models showed strong underestimation.

### ðŸ’» **Coding-Level Enhancements (2025)**

1. **3D U-Net Architecture**

   * Uses 3D convolutions to process monthly Sentinel-2 time series:

     ```python
     # Input shape: [Batch, Channels, Time=12, Height, Width]
     nn.Conv3d(in_channels=12 * bands + radar_channels, out_channels=64, kernel_size=(3,3,3))
     ```
   * Radar (Sentinel-1) is repeated across time dimension to match the shape.

2. **Shift-Aware Supervision**

   * Incorporates per-track spatial offsets to compensate for GEDI LiDAR misalignment (Â±10m).
   * This corrects systematic biases during backpropagation.

3. **Data Augmentation**

   * UTM-tiled patches of 2.56Ã—2.56 km size are sampled randomly, with only \~0.15% of pixels containing labels.
   * Dataset size: 800,000 patches (8TB).

4. **Loss Function**

   * Modified Huber loss applied only to labeled pixels:

     ```python
     def modified_huber_loss(pred, target):
         # delta = 1
         diff = pred - target
         loss = torch.where(diff.abs() < 1, 0.5 * diff ** 2, 1 * (diff.abs() - 0.5))
         return loss.mean()
     ```

5. **Temporal Smoothing**

   * A smoothing spline (quadratic, smoothing factor=5) is applied to reduce year-to-year prediction variance due to seasonal shifts and sensor noise.

### ðŸŒ² **Addressing Underestimation of Tall Trees**

**Problem in 2024:** Canopy heights above 30m were systematically underestimated, likely due to:

* Loss of detail in median composites.
* Lack of temporal vegetation change cues.
* Model saturation in height prediction.

**Solutions in 2025:**

1. **Temporal Modeling:** Seasonal signals from monthly Sentinel-2 images capture growth patterns and structural cues (e.g., leaf-on/leaf-off).
2. **3D Convolutions:** Exploit temporal and spatial context, mitigating the height saturation problem.
3. **Better Supervision:** Use of GEDI rh98 metric and shift correction ensures higher alignment with true canopy peaks.
4. **Improved Training Regime:** Multi-year training and smoothing help generalize better across extremes in canopy height.

ðŸ“Š **Results:**
Mean error for 35â€“40m trees reduced to \~âˆ’5 m from prior \~âˆ’10 m (see Figure 3 in the paper).

# 2D Model Training Results - June 2025

## Executive Summary

This document details the successful implementation and results of 2D canopy height modeling using Random Forest, MLP, and 2D U-Net models on the Annuna HPC cluster. The work implements GEDI sample filtering, generates prediction patches for all 27 available patches, and establishes a production-ready workflow for non-temporal canopy height mapping.

## Training Configuration

### Data Processing
- **Input Data**: 27 patches from `chm_outputs/` directory
- **Patch Format**: Non-temporal 31-band TIF files (256×256 pixels, 10m resolution)
- **Patch Pattern**: `*_bandNum31_*.tif` (non-temporal data)
- **GEDI Filtering**: Minimum 10 valid samples per patch for training inclusion
- **Training Area**: 2.56km × 2.56km per patch

### Model Architecture
```
Band Configuration:
- Total bands: 31 (30 feature bands + 1 GEDI reference band)
- Feature bands: Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ALOS-2, DEM derivatives
- Resolution: 10m pixel size
- Patch size: 256×256 pixels (2.56km × 2.56km)
```

### GEDI Quality Control Implementation
- **Filtering Criteria**: 
  - Valid height range: 0-100m
  - Non-NaN values
  - Pre-filtered: SRTM slope ≤ 20°
  - Minimum samples per patch: 10 (configurable)
- **Training vs Prediction Mode**:
  - Training: Applies GEDI filtering (skips patches with insufficient samples)
  - Prediction: Processes all patches regardless of GEDI availability

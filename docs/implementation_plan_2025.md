    'supported_scales': [10, 30],  # All supported resolutions
    'patch_sizes': {
        10: 2560,  # 256 pixels × 10m = 2560m  
        30: 7680   # 256 pixels × 30m = 7680m
    },

    """
    return RESOLUTION_CONFIG['patch_sizes'].get(scale, 2560)
```

### 1.4 Handling Non-Divisible Areas
When processing areas that don't perfectly divide by the patch size:

1. **Patch Grid Creation**:
   - Calculate number of patches needed by rounding up
   - Adjust patch sizes to ensure complete coverage
   - Mark patches that extend beyond original bounds
   - Maintain consistent pixel count (256x256) regardless of resolution

2. **Processing Strategy**:
   - Process all patches including extruded ones
   - Keep track of which patches are extruded
   - Apply masking to remove predictions in extruded areas
   - Ensure consistent pixel dimensions across resolutions

3. **Resolution Handling**:
   - Support both 10m and 30m resolutions
   - Adjust patch sizes to maintain 256x256 pixels:
     * 10m resolution: 2560m × 2560m patches
     * 30m resolution: 7680m × 7680m patches
   - Ensure consistent processing across resolutions

4. **Output Generation**:
   - Merge predictions from all patches
   - Apply masking to remove extruded areas
   - Ensure final output matches original area bounds
   - Maintain consistent pixel dimensions in output
```

### 1.5 Input Normalization Strategy (✅ IMPLEMENTED)

```python
# ✅ Implemented in data/normalization.py

def normalize_sentinel1_db(s1_db):
    """
    ✅ Normalize Sentinel-1 dB values
    Input: dB values (typically -30 to 10)
    Output: Normalized values
    """
    return (s1_db + 25) / 25

def normalize_sentinel2_reflectance(s2_refl):
    """
    ✅ Normalize Sentinel-2 reflectance values
    Input: Reflectance (0 to 10000)
    Output: Normalized values (0 to 1)
    """
    return s2_refl / 10000

def normalize_ndvi(ndvi):
    """
    ✅ NDVI normalization with clipping
    Input: NDVI (-1 to 1)
    Output: Clipped and normalized
    """
    return np.clip(ndvi, -1, 1)

# ✅ Additional normalizations implemented for:
# - DEM elevation, slope, aspect
# - ALOS-2 SAR data
# - Canopy height data
# - All temporal and non-temporal modes
```

# 🚧 Phase 2: Multi-Patch Training and Geospatial Prediction Merging

## Status: 🔄 IN PLANNING - Multi-Patch Training System Enhancement

## 9. Multi-Patch Training System Design

### 9.1 Current Patch File Creation Analysis

    - GEDI data is embedded as 'rh' band with sparse coverage
    - Forest mask included as separate band
    """
    
    # Example filenames generated:
    # - dchm_09gd4_bandNum31_scale10_patch0000.tif      (non-temporal)
    # - dchm_09gd4_temporal_bandNum196_scale10_patch0001.tif  (temporal)
    
    # Each patch exports to Google Drive with:
    # - fileNamePrefix: Contains patch metadata

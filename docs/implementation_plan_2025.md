    'patch_sizes': {
        10: 2560,  # 256 pixels × 10m = 2560m  
        30: 7680   # 256 pixels × 30m = 7680m
    },

    """
    return RESOLUTION_CONFIG['patch_sizes'].get(scale, 2560)
```

### 1.4 Handling Non-Divisible Areas
When processing areas that don't perfectly divide by the patch size:

1. **Patch Grid Creation**:
   - Calculate number of patches needed by rounding up
   - Adjust patch sizes to ensure complete coverage
   - Mark patches that extend beyond original bounds
   - Maintain consistent pixel count (256x256) regardless of resolution

2. **Processing Strategy**:
   - Process all patches including extruded ones
   - Keep track of which patches are extruded
   - Apply masking to remove predictions in extruded areas
   - Ensure consistent pixel dimensions across resolutions

3. **Resolution Handling**:
   - Support both 10m and 30m resolutions
   - Adjust patch sizes to maintain 256x256 pixels:
     * 10m resolution: 2560m × 2560m patches
     * 30m resolution: 7680m × 7680m patches
   - Ensure consistent processing across resolutions

4. **Output Generation**:
   - Merge predictions from all patches
   - Apply masking to remove extruded areas
   - Ensure final output matches original area bounds
   - Maintain consistent pixel dimensions in output
```

### 1.5 Input Normalization Strategy (✅ IMPLEMENTED)

```python
# ✅ Implemented in data/normalization.py

def normalize_sentinel1_db(s1_db):
    """
    ✅ Normalize Sentinel-1 dB values
    Input: dB values (typically -30 to 10)
    Output: Normalized values
    """
    return (s1_db + 25) / 25

def normalize_sentinel2_reflectance(s2_refl):
    """
    ✅ Normalize Sentinel-2 reflectance values
    Input: Reflectance (0 to 10000)
    Output: Normalized values (0 to 1)
    """
    return s2_refl / 10000

def normalize_ndvi(ndvi):
    """
    ✅ NDVI normalization with clipping
    Input: NDVI (-1 to 1)
    Output: Clipped and normalized
    """
    return np.clip(ndvi, -1, 1)

# ✅ Additional normalizations implemented for:
# - DEM elevation, slope, aspect
# - ALOS-2 SAR data
# - Canopy height data
# - All temporal and non-temporal modes
```

  ⎿  Enhanced Training Strategy Plan for train_predict_map.py

     Current State Analysis

     The current train_predict_map.py has basic multi-patch capabilities but lacks:
     - Data Augmentation: No spatial transformations (rotations, flips)
     - Proper Batch Training: U-Net models only train on first patch
     - Early Stopping: Limited validation and no patience-based stopping
     - Memory Efficiency: Loads all patches simultaneously
     - Training Persistence: Limited checkpoint/resume capabilities

     Enhancement Plan

     1. Data Augmentation System (60 → 720 effective images)

     - Spatial Transformations: 3 flips × 4 rotations = 12x augmentation
     - On-the-fly Generation: Memory efficient augmentation during training
     - Geospatial Consistency: Apply same transforms to features and GEDI targets
     - Configurable: --augment-factor parameter (default: 12)

     2. Enhanced Batch Training Pipeline

     - True Multi-Patch Training: All models train on all patches
     - Configurable Batch Size: Default 32, adjustable for GPU memory
     - PyTorch DataLoaders: Efficient batch loading with workers
     - Memory Streaming: Load patches on-demand, not all at once

     3. Early Stopping & Model Checkpointing

     - Validation Split: 80/20 train/validation across patches
     - Early Stopping: Stop after 10-20 epochs without improvement
     - Best Model Saving: Save model with lowest validation loss
     - Training Resumption: Resume from checkpoints with state

     4. Enhanced U-Net Training

     - Multi-Patch DataLoader: Custom dataset class for patch-based training
     - Gradient Accumulation: Handle large batch sizes with limited memory
     - Learning Rate Scheduling: Adaptive learning rate with warmup
     - Mixed Precision: Faster training with automatic mixed precision

     5. Training Results Persistence

     - Comprehensive Logging: Loss curves, metrics, training time
     - Model Artifacts: Best models, checkpoints, configurations
     - Visualization: Training curves, augmentation examples
     - Evaluation Integration: Automatic evaluation on completion

     Implementation Updates

     New Files:

     - train_predict_map.py (enhanced with augmentation classes)
     - Training results saved to organized output structure

     Key Classes:

     - AugmentedPatchDataset: PyTorch dataset with 12x augmentation
     - EarlyStoppingCallback: Patience-based training control
     - TrainingLogger: Comprehensive training metrics tracking
     - EnhancedUNetTrainer: Proper multi-patch U-Net training
